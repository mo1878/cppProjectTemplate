# Welcome to the C++ Project Template for VSCode.

This is a command line tool built in Golang using Cobra. 

The main purpose of this CLI is to create a project structure that can be used to build C++ applications on VSCode. 

While trying to learn C++ I noticed the lack of a general template that could be used when learning C++ or building C++ applications on VSCode for MacOS.

So I thought it would be a great Idea to learn how this can be done in another language I'm trying to learn - Golang.

This is the first iteration of the project template builder and only comes with one command:

```zsh 

initTemplate [Argument]

```

# How To Use?

Simply clone this repository down to your local machine, then add the `cppProjectTemplate` executable file to your `PATH`. This will allow you to call the template from any location on your machine.


# Initialise Your First Project

Simply run the following code - Replace 'sampleProject' with whatever project name you like - to generate a Project template with the relevant files to get started with building a C++ application.

```zsh
cppProjectTemplate initTemplate sampleProject
```
